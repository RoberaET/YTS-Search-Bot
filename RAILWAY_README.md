# 🚀 Railway-Compatible Movie Search Bot

## ⚠️ Important Notice

This version has been modified to comply with Railway's content policies. The torrent download functionality has been removed to ensure successful deployment.

## 🔧 What's Different?

### ✅ **Available Features:**
- **Movie Search** - Search for any movie on YTS.mx
- **Movie Information** - Get IMDb ratings, genres, year
- **Movie Posters** - See movie cover images

### ❌ **Removed Features:**

## 🎯 **Why This Change?**

Railway has strict policies against hosting applications that deal with torrent files or torrent-related content. This version provides all the movie information and search capabilities while directing users to YTS.mx for downloads.

## 📱 **How It Works Now:**

1. **Search for Movies** - `/search movie_name` or just type the movie name
2. **Get Movie Info** - IMDb rating, genres, year, poster
3. **Visit YTS.mx** - Click the link to go to the movie page
4. **Download There** - Users can download torrents directly from YTS.mx

## 🚀 **Deployment:**

This version will deploy successfully on Railway without any content policy violations.

## 💡 **User Experience:**

Users still get:
- ✅ Movie search results
- ✅ Movie posters and information
- ✅ IMDb ratings
- ✅ Direct links to YTS.mx
- ✅ All the search functionality

The only difference is that users need to visit YTS.mx to download torrents, which is actually safer and more reliable.

## 🔄 **Alternative Deployment Options:**

If you need the full torrent functionality, consider:
- **Heroku** - More permissive policies
- **DigitalOcean** - VPS hosting
- **AWS/GCP** - Cloud hosting
- **Local hosting** - Run on your own server

## 📞 **Support:**

This version maintains all the core functionality while being Railway-compliant. Users can still find movies and get all the information they need!
